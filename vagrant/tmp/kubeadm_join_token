[reset] Deleting contents of stateful directories: [/var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/dockershim /var/run/kubernetes /var/lib/cni]

The reset process does not clean CNI configuration. To do so, you must remove /etc/cni/net.d

The reset process does not reset or clean up iptables rules or IPVS tables.
If you wish to reset iptables, you must do so manually by using the "iptables" command.

If your cluster was setup to utilize IPVS, run ipvsadm --clear (or similar)
to reset your system's IPVS tables.

The reset process does not clean your kubeconfig files and you must remove them manually.
Please, check the contents of the $HOME/.kube/config file.

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 0.0.0.0:443 --token 3b3212.l4gzzwohbl6wo4b3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ec3c5f307f6627174b20bb4da5135bfa48587c8280b4117a699092a9494f58c7 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key 8fcd6e2b9fe796c2eba1b33b301deaa8feacf784303765d4cdc61963f55d8879

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 0.0.0.0:443 --token 3b3212.l4gzzwohbl6wo4b3 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:ec3c5f307f6627174b20bb4da5135bfa48587c8280b4117a699092a9494f58c7
